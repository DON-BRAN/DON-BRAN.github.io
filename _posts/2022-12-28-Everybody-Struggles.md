The struggle you're in today is developing the strength you need for tomorrow. Don’t give up!

Strength comes from struggle and It is an opportunity to become stronger, better, and wiser. This is the mentality I have been cultivating from the beginning of my Internship with the Zarr community.

I have been working on creating tutorials for Zarr which requires me to go through zarr's [documentations](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [API references](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html), [specifications](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec.html), and current [tutorials](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html). This has been an exciting yet challenging experience for me.

Part of my task requires me to go through the [current Zarr tutorial](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html) and suggest improvements. When I started working on that, I found myself asking the question "What am I looking for here ...". It all looks perfect!! This was a major challenge for me as I didn't know where to start hunting for possible improvements. I kept going through the resources made available to me by my mentors over and over again but didn’t quite get where to start. I wasn’t sure of how to ask my mentors where to begin hunting for improvements. I was afraid this would make me seem unfit for the task, so I kept going in circles digging and digging through resources looking for improvements rather than asking my mentors to guide me (Silly me!).

My mentors [Josh Moore](https://github.com/joshmoore) and [Sanket Verma](https://github.com/MSanKeys963) made me realize I don't have to feel nervous sharing my challenges with them no matter how small (Petty) it may seem. 

I learnt it is very important to seek assistance in your struggles rather than trying to solve it all on your own. I wish I had realized this earlier. 

I am excited and curious to see how the next weeks of my internship unfolds working with my amazing mentors to contribute to the Zarr community.
