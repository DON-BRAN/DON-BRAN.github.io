I am Awa Brandon Awa (he/his) I am a Cameroonian, I am 23, I love basketball, video games and food!

Currently learning front-end development

My core values are courage, commitment and freedom.

Courage is the mental, moral, and physical strength that was deeply embedded in me by my family.  To have courage is to be brave. Courage is an essential core value in life. Courage gives you the 
confidence to be yourself, even in the face of criticism.

My greatest strength has come from the energy of commitment. It is the spirit of determination and dedication. Commitment is what transforms your promises into reality.

And lastly freedom! I believe everyone should be free to practice whatever, go into any field of choice as long as it makes them happy.
